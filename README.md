# 📊 Titanic Mini Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs a Mini Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python.  
It is part of the **Data Science with Python Internship** and focuses on data cleaning, feature engineering, group-based analysis, and data visualization to understand passenger survival patterns.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset  
- Handle missing values using imputation  
- Remove irrelevant columns  
- Perform survival analysis using groupby operations  
- Analyze survival trends based on age group, embarkation port, and family size  
- Create clear and professional visualizations  

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Filled missing values in the **Age** column using the mean  
- Removed irrelevant columns such as **Cabin**  
- Created new features:
  - **Age Group**
  - **Family Size** (SibSp + Parch)

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis
The following analyses are performed:
- Survival rate by **Age Group**
- Survival rate by **Embarkation Port**
- Survival rate by **Family Size**

---

## 📊 Visualizations
- Age distribution histogram  
- Correlation heatmap  
- Survival rate by family size (bar plot)  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- **Dataset Source:** Kaggle
